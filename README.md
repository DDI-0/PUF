Introduction

This project explores Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs) as a mechanism for generating cryptographically secure random numbers.\
It involves simulating and implementing a Ring Oscillator-based Physical Unclonable Function (RO-PUF) using SPICE simulations and an Intel MAX 10 FPGA.

Project Objectives

Implement a PUF using a Ring Oscillator model.

Develop VHDL models for FPGA implementation.

Automate the generation of Ring Oscillator circuits.
